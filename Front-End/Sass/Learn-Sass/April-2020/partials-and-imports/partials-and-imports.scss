/* Partials and Imports
============================= */

/* Sass allows you to create partial files.
     This can help keep your Sass code modularized. 
     Partial files should begin with an '_' e.g. _reset.css.
          Partials are not generated into CSS. */

/* Sass offers @import which can be used to import partials into a file.
     
This differs from the traditional CSS @import statement which makes another HTTP request to fetch the imported file. 

Sass takes the imported file and combines it with the compiled code. */


@import 'reset';
