/* Extending a CSS statement is preferable to creating a mixin
     because of the way Sass groups together the classes that all share
     the same base styling. If this was done with a mixin, the width,
     height, and border would be duplicated for each statement that
     called the mixin. While it won't affect your workflow, it will
     add unnecessary bloat to the files created by the Sass compiler. */
