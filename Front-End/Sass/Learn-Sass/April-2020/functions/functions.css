/* You may also define your own functions. 
     Functions are very similar to mixins. 
     When trying to choose between a function or a mixin, 
     remember that mixins are best for generating CSS while 
     functions are better for logic that might be used 
     throughout your Sass code. The examples in the 
     'Math Operators' section are ideal candidates for becoming a reusable function. */
/* This function will take a target size and the parent size and calculate and return the percentage */
.main-content {
